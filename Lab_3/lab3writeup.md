<figcaption>Figure ES.2 - Functional verification of the mixer. The RF is an 8 MHz signal being mixed with a 12 MHz LO. The up and down converted signals are visible in the frequency domain (right hand picture) at 4 and 20 MHz. There is a noticable amount of LO leakage seen at 12 MHz. Three other spurs are visible between 8 and 10 MHz, and at 16 MHz. </figcaption>

## Measurements and Results

To study the 1 dBm compression point and conversion gain/loss, the IF power was measured for different RF powers. The LO was an 8 MHz sinusoid at 7 dBm. The input RF power was stepped from -1 dBm to 7 dBm in +1 dBm increments. At each step, the output IF power was measured. From this data, the 1 dBm compression point and conversion loss were computed and are shown in figures MR.1 and MR.2.

Figure MR.1 reveals that the diode ring mixer reaches its 1 dBm compression point around 1 dBm of RF power.

<figcaption>Figure MR.2 - Computed conversion loss as a function of different RF powers. The conversion loss is around 6 dBm for RF powers below 1 mW. The convesrion loss is in dBm computed according to <code>convesrion = (IF power)[dBm] - (RF power)[dBm].</code></figcaption>

<figcaption>Figure MR.3 - Spur levels of the mixer when the LO is a 7 dBm 30 MHz sinusoid and the RF is a 0 dBm 7 MHz sinusoid. The span of the spectrum is 60 MHz so many spurs can be seen. The up and down mixed IF signals have around -10 dBm power and are distinct from the spurs. </figcaption>

<figcaption>Figure MR.4 - The IF signal from mixing a 30 MHz LO with a 29.85 MHz RF signal. The IF signal is about 50 dBm above the noise floor. The IF signal has a power of -6 dBm. The minimum IF frequency is lower than 150 kHz.</figcaption>

<figcaption>Figure MR.5 - The IF signal from mixing a 30 MHz LO with a 29.90 MHz RF signal. The IF signal is less than 50 dBm above the noise floor. The IF signal has a power of -10 dBm. Intermodulation spurs have about 150 kHz of separation. The minimum IF frequency is lower than 150 kHz.</figcaption>

<figcaption>Figure MR.6 - The IF signal from mixing a 30 MHz LO with a 29.99 MHz RF signal. The IF signal is less than 30 dBm above the noise floor. The IF signal has a power of -30 dBm. Intermodulation spurs have about 75 kHz of separation. One confusing part of this line of investigation is that the notion of when the signal is indistguishable is not well defined.</figcaption>

## Discussion
todo

- We talked about the 1dB compression point. Why is this an important performance metric? Can we change it? If so, how might we do that?
- There was some discussion about LO leakage. Why is that important and what can be done about that?
- Did you use your mixer as an up converter? As a down converter? If you didn't try both of these, why not?
- Did you measure the conversion gain vs LO drive level. I guess you must have if you determined the 1dB compression point. How did you make those measurements? Was this at a single frequency? If so was there anything special about the frequency you chose? If you did the measurements at different frequencies, did you find about the same result?
- There were a number of questions about why one would be concerned about the minimum IF frequency. Greig pointed out that the diode ring mixer should "go to DC" but that the FET ring wouldn't. Why might that be something one would be concerned about? What about the Gilbert cell mixer; should that "go to DC"? Does all this have anything to do with zero IF SDR's or radar stuff?
- In the mixer you built, why wouldn't the mixer go to zero IF? What could be done if you want it to go to zero IF?
