## Abstract
Mixers are ubiquitos in RF systems. In this lab, we gain hands on experience with how diode-ring mixers work by building one. Then, we attemp to measure some fundamental performance characteristics of the mixer. As a result of this work, we are capable in understanding the role mixers play in a larger circuit and how to quantify its ability to mix well.
## Background

Fundamentally, mixers multiply time domain signals. As a result of the signals being sinusoids, the multiplication generates the sum and difference frequencies of those input sinusoids. The mixer goes by many other names, including "modulator / demodulator", "multiplier", "synchronous detector", "phase detector", "upconverter / downconverter". These names hint at the many applications a mixer is used in, e.g. modulation/demodulating a signal to encode information.

Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?V_1(t)=A_1\cos(\omega_1t)" title="V_1(t)=A_1\cos(\omega_1t)" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?V_2(t)=A_2\cos(\omega_2t)" title="V_2(t)=A_2\cos(\omega_2t)" />. Then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?V_1(t)\cdot&space;V_2(t)=\frac{A_1A_2}{2}[\cos(\omega_1&space;&plus;&space;\omega_2)t&space;&plus;&space;\cos(\omega_1-\omega_2)t]" title="V_1(t)\cdot V_2(t)=\frac{A_1A_2}{2}[\cos(\omega_1 + \omega_2)t + \cos(\omega_1-\omega_2)t]" />. Mixing sinusoids generates a sum and difference frequency.

For downconversion, a mixer requires a radio frequency signal (RF) and a local oscillator (LO) to generate an intermediate frequency signal (IF). For upconversion, a mixer requires an IF signal and an LO to generate *two* RF signals. Figure B.1 shows two examples of frequency conversion.[^1] 

[^1]: Figure B.1 is taken from Steve Clark's slides for Stanford's EE133 course during the Winter of 2022 offering.

The figure demonstrates high side injection in the downconversion case. High side injection means your LO frequency is higher than your RF signal.

Mixing can be done with the double balanced diode-ring circuit in Figure B.2. The mixer is completely passive -- there are no active devices in the circuit. This fact has consequences for conversion gain/loss and will be explored later.

## Experimental Setup

Figure ES.1 shows the constructed mixer. Figure ES.2 (left) shows the same mixer being driven by a signal generator and being measured by a spectrum analyzer.

<figcaption>Figure ES.2 - Functional verification of the mixer. The RF is an 8 MHz signal being mixed with a 12 MHz LO. The sum and difference signals are visible in the frequency domain (right hand picture) at 4 and 20 MHz. There is a noticable amount of LO leakage seen at 12 MHz. Three other spurs are visible between 8 and 10 MHz, and at 16 MHz. </figcaption>
</figure>

The right side of Figure ES.2 shows a close up of the spectrum for the mixing of an 8 MHz RF signal with a 12 MHz LO. The sum and difference frequencies are at 4 and 20 MHz. The LO leakage can be visibally seen at the frequency of the local oscillator, 12 MHz -- the spectral power of the LO is 100 times smaller than the power of either the sum or difference frequencies. Many other spurs can be seen, which are most likely the result of intermodulation due to the nonlinear diode ring.

All spectrum analyzer measurements used 100 samples of exponentially-weighted averaging.
## Measurements and Results

To study the 1 dBm compression point and conversion gain/loss, the IF power was measured for different RF. The LO was an 8 MHz sinusoid at 7 dBm. The input RF power was stepped from -1 dBm to 7 dBm in +1 dBm increments. At each step, the output IF power was measured. From this data, the 1 dBm compression point and conversion loss were computed and are shown in figures MR.1 and MR.2.

</figure>

Figure MR.1 reveals that the diode ring mixer reaches its 1 dBm compression point just under 2 dBm of RF power. The "ideal" IF curve was computed according to <code>IdealIFpower = RFpower + conversion[1]</code> where <code>conversion[1]</code> is the conversion loss of a 0 dBm RF signal. The code which made these charts is in <code>graphs.py</code> of this folder.

Figure MR.2 reveals that the conversion loss of the mixer is not constant across RF powers. The chart suggests that the diode ring mixer has a maximum amount of power it can output. This result is derived from the fact that as RF power increases, the conversion loss grows larger. By the formula for conversion gain (<code>convesrion = (IF power)[dBm] - (RF power)[dBm].</code>), the data suggests that the output IF power delivered to the spectrum analyzer is constant beyond some point. More investigation is needed to understand the true source of the conversion loss.

<figcaption>Figure MR.2 - Computed conversion loss as a function of different RF powers. The conversion loss is around 6 dBm for RF powers below 1 mW. The convesrion loss is in dBm computed according to <code>convesrion = (IF power)[dBm] - (RF power)[dBm].</code></figcaption>
</figure>

The conversion loss of the passive diode-ring mixer at low RF powers is around -6 dB. This number is about what is expected according to the following <a href="https://www.qsl.net/va3iul/RF%20Mixers/RF_Mixers.pdf"> publication</a>.

Figure MR.3 shows the spur levels of the mixer when the LO is a 7 dBm 30 MHz sinusoid and the RF is a 0 dBm 7 MHz sinusoid. Over a 60 MHz span many spurs are visible. The up and down mixed IF signals have around -10 dBm power and are distinct from the other spurs. The different spurious frequencies are given by the formula <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?f_{spur}=mf_{RF}&plus;nf_{LO}\;\forall&space;m,n&space;\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}" title="f_{spur}=mf_{RF}+nf_{LO}\;\forall m,n \in\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}" />. Because the sum and difference frequencies are at least 30 dB (1000x power difference) above the other spurs we conclude that the mixer is suitable in a larger circuit.

The most difficult measurement to make in the lab was the minimum IF because the notion of when to stop was unclear for the author. Intuitively, the minimum IF signal is the signal at the lowest frequency possible that is still discernable from noise and distortion. However, the authors believe that "minimum discernability" is a function of the device that is on the receiver-end of the mixer. In this lab, that device is the spectrum analyzer. 

This belief motivated the investigation shown by figures MR.4,5, and 6. To find the minimum IF frequency, we fixed the LO at 30 MHz and stepped the RF from 7 MHz to 29.99 MHz. The LO was driven with 7 dBm power while the RF signal was driven with 0 dBm.

Figures MR.4,5, and 6 show the IF at 150 kHz, 100 kHz, and 10 kHz.

## Discussion
todo

- We talked about the 1dB compression point. Why is this an important performance metric? Can we change it? If so, how might we do that?
- There was some discussion about LO leakage. Why is that important and what can be done about that?
- Did you use your mixer as an up converter? As a down converter? If you didn't try both of these, why not?
- Did you measure the conversion gain vs LO drive level. I guess you must have if you determined the 1dB compression point. How did you make those measurements? Was this at a single frequency? If so was there anything special about the frequency you chose? If you did the measurements at different frequencies, did you find about the same result?
- There were a number of questions about why one would be concerned about the minimum IF frequency. Greig pointed out that the diode ring mixer should "go to DC" but that the FET ring wouldn't. Why might that be something one would be concerned about? What about the Gilbert cell mixer; should that "go to DC"? Does all this have anything to do with zero IF SDR's or radar stuff?
- In the mixer you built, why wouldn't the mixer go to zero IF? What could be done if you want it to go to zero IF?
