## Abstract

- Clocks are basically in ALMOST EVERY system you will work on
## Background

Previous iterations of Stanford University's Analog Communications Design Laboratory (EE133/233) had a lab on oscillators. In the past, they built ![Colpitts oscillators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colpitts_oscillator). Times have changed and the current landscape of electronics is such that the number of times one will need to generate a clock is far greater than the number of times one would benefit from building a Colpitts oscillator. 

This lab is meant to introduce the emerging engineer to a *modern*, low-cost, and widely used clock generator -- the ![Si5351](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/Si5351.pdf). This part has a low price point, reasonable performance, and successful history (it is used in the NanoVNA V2 that was used in Lab1!).[^1]

goals:
in two hours or less, give you a very capable multi-channel clock generator that you could
- use for your projects
- take with you as you move forward in your career
- use to think about how clock generation works (fractional-N PLLs, etc.)

## Discussion

- The manufacturer claims that an Si5351 can generate frequencies from around 8 kHz to around 160 MHz. The recommended crystal frequency is 25 MHz. How can it generate frequencies in excess of 6X the basic clock rate?
- How do I know which frequencies are able to be generated?
- Can I modify the CircuitPython code to generate a frequency (or two) of my choice?
- Does it really work to write TRUE or FALSE to a particular place and turn that particular output ON / OFF?
- It seems like when the output frequency is "high" the square wave output turns into a more sinusoidal waveform. Why is that?
- What if I want a sine wave, or triangle wave, or saw-tooth wave... Can I use this to generate those waveforms?
- I've been thinking a lot about generating in-phase (I) and in-quadrature (Q) signals to drive mixers. Can I use this clock generator to directly generate I & Q for my mixer drive?
- If I wanted to try designing a PLL, might this be a gizmo that I could use to test my PLL?
- What is phase noise? And how is it related to "jitter"? And it this a low-noise part? Or not? How can I tell?
- So, Steve, if this is used for the "low frequency regime", what is used in the "high frequency regime" to provide the signal source in the NanoVNA V2 Plus4?
